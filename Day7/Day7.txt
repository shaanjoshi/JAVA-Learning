>> Function 
    -> A block of code which takes input, performs some operation and gives output
    ---> Input ------> Operation -----> output

    -> public static returnType functionName(type arg1, type arg2...){
        # operation 
    } 

        -> returnType can be anything like int, dloat string and so on.
            It can only return single type of value. 
            It means what kind of value it can return.
            for example:
                int -> this type returns integer type variable
                float -> this type will reurn float type variable
                void -> this means no return. Used in main function of the code. 
        -> public, static are written before the main class or primary class of any code. This will be discussed later while learing OOPs

        -> functionName-> can be anything accepts java keywords
        -> arguments-> means inputs, for giving any argument/input we need to define its type.


    -> What happens in memory when we create function?
        -> All the function get saved in form of stack in the memory
        -> When any single thing is saved to stack it is known as stack frame
        -> When we created main function the first frame will be of Main() function which includes all its variable
        -> When main function calls the other secondary function, another stack frame got created for a new function including all the variables
        -> Now when the secondary function got completly executed and returns the output to the main function then its stack frame gets removed from memory
        -> Once main function complete its execution then its stack frame also gets removed.
