    System.out.print("Hello World\n");

    # ";"-> Terminate
    # output printed using system class

>> Variable and constant
>> Datatypes
    > JAVA is typed language. which means we need to define the type of variable before using it.
    . Two types of Datatypes:
        > Primitive: pre-defined Datatypes

            > byte(1byte or 8bits), short, char(2 bytes), boolean(1 bytes), int(4 bytes), long(8), float, double
        > Non-Primitive: Can be customized

            > String, Array, Class, Object, Interface

     public class Day2 {
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            //variables
            int a = 25;
            int b = 10;
            int sum = a + b;
            System.out.println(sum);
            int diff = a-b;
            System.out.println(diff);
            int mult = a*b;
            System.out.println(mult);
    
        }
    }

>> Input: In jAVA we use scanner class to get the input
import java.util.*;
public class Day2 {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        //input
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);  // Here Scanner is class and "sc" is the object created out of it
        String name = sc.next();    // Next is the function here associated with the Sacnner
        String fullName = sc.nextLine();
        System.out.println(name);
        // nextInt()
        // nextFloat()
        System.out.println(fullName);

    }
}

>> Homework Problems
Try to declare meaningful variables of each type. Eg - a variable named age should be a numeric type (int or float) not byte.
Make a program that takes the radius of a circle as input, calculates its radius and area and prints it as output to the user.
Make a program that prints the table of a number that is input by the user. 
(HINT - You will have to write 10 lines for this but as we proceed in the course you will be studying about ‘LOOPS’ that will simplify your work A LOT!)
